# PacMen
This repository contains the PacMen Exercise Assignment 

<h3>How to Run: </h3>
<p>
  1. Open the file containing the code you want to run. This can be done through the GitHub website or by downloading the file to your computer.

  2. Check the code to make sure it is correct. Reading through the code and identifying any errors or typos can help ensure the code runs smoothly.

  3. Run the code. Depending on the type of code and the language itâ€™s written in, there are various methods of running the code. If it is in a language like Python, you might use the command line interpreter to run the code. If it is a script of some sort, you can run it through a command line utility such as Bash. Alternatively, if the code is written in a language that requires a compiler, you might need to install the appropriate software to run the code.

<h4>Future Improvements: </h4>
<p>
  I would improve this project by adding the 'food' in order to make it more like the game. 
  I would also like to add the 'evil' PacMen in order to have a "game over" status.
